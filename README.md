# Ruby on Rails Tutorial

## "hello, world!"

This is the first application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/). Hello, world!

You can change the config/routes.rb file in order to display "goodbye, world!" on the HTML page, but the default behavior is simply displaying "Â¡hola, mundo!".

You can see it live [here](https://warm-earth-20295.herokuapp.com).
